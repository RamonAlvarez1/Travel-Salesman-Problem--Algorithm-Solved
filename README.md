Finding an optimized solution of the Travel's Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Algorithms

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is an algorithmic problem tasked with finding the shortest route between a set of points and locations that must be visited. 
In the problem statement, the points are the cities a salesperson might visit.

We approach this problem, generating a graph with the cities as nodes and the aristas as the distance between them.
