# Travel-Salesman-Problem--Algorithm-Solved
Finding an optimized solution of the TravelÂ´s Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms and Swarn Algorithms

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is an algorithmic problem tasked with finding the shortest route between a set of points and locations that must be visited. 
In the problem statement, the points are the cities a salesperson might visit.

We approach this problem generating a graph with the cities as a nodes and the arists as the distance between them.
